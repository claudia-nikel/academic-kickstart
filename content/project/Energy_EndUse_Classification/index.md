Deployed a Python program to classify live-streaming equipment end-uses using hierarchical clustering with 95% accuracy <br/>
- Deployed a Python program to manipulate and predict on 66 million rows of NoSQL data
- Solved a business problem by predicting 200+ sensors into 6 end-uses for anomaly detection
- Identified data discrepancies in Python that improved model accuracy by 5%

<br/>

Consulted with technical and non-technical stakeholders <br/>
- Addressed data type issues to the senior leadership team that improved data warehousing 
- Translated statistical techniques and model results to the senior leadership team 

<br/>
Collaborative coding with the data science team <br/>
- Guided data science team through statistical techniques that improved model performance 
- Managed analytics project with 3 data scientists that resulted in model delivery after 2 months

<br/>
An API to retrieve and visualize weather data from the last 7 Sols (Martian days) as recorded and updated daily by NASA's InSight Mars lander. InSight is located at Elysium Planitia, a flat surface near the equator of Mars. The python package built contains four functions:
